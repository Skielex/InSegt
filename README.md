# InSegt

Code accompanying our paper *Content-based Propagation of User Markings for Interactive Segmentation of Patterned Images*, to be published at CVMI workshop at CVPR 2020. Earlier version of the paper is on arxiv: [1809.02226](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02226.pdf).

Our interactive segmentation will, guided by the image content, propagate user markings to similar structures in the rest of the image. This allows easy segmentation of complex structures. For example, in images below, on the left, the input image has  a small subset of manually marked pixels. On the right, the manual labelling has been propagated to the whole image.
