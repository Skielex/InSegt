Code accompanying our paper Content-based Propagation of User Markings for Interactive Segmentation of Patterned Images. Earlier version of the paper is on arxiv: [1809.02226](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02226.pdf).

Our interactive segmentation will, guided by the image content, propagate user markings to similar structures in the rest of the image, allows easy segmentation of complex structures. 

In images below, on the left are user markings on images, and on the right resulting segmantation.
